# Math Assessment Images

This folder contains the images used in the math assessment application. The images are organized by topic and mapped in the `image-mapping.json` file.

## Image Guidelines

2. No text or numbers in the images
3. Use child-friendly, fun designs
4. Save as PNG format
5. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels
6. Use clear, solid colors

## Adding New Images
1. Add your image file to this folder
2. Update the `image-mapping.json` file to include your image in the appropriate topic
3. Image filenames should be descriptive and use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `red-apple.png`)
